# Distribution Network Analysis: Capacity Planning for Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption
# PowerCharge Utilities: Business Overview

## Problem
PowerCharge Utilities encounters several critical challenges due to the growing adoption of electric vehicles:

### A. Increased Load Demand
Widespread EV adoption has caused a significant spike in electricity demand, particularly during peak charging times. This strains the existing distribution network infrastructure.

### B. Grid Overloads
Frequent overloads in the distribution network lead to voltage fluctuations and outages in specific areas, affecting overall grid reliability.

### C. Customer Satisfaction
EV owners expect reliable and convenient charging services. Ensuring this level of service is essential to maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### D. Cost Management
Balancing increased load demands and grid reliability comes at a significant cost. PowerCharge Utilities must optimize network investments to manage expenses effectively.

## Rationale for the Project
Distribution Network Analysis in the energy industry refers to the process of studying and evaluating the electrical distribution networks that deliver electricity from high-voltage transmission lines to end-users, such as homes, businesses, and industrial facilities. This analysis becomes even more critical with the rise of EVs, as it transforms the energy landscape.

### Top Five Reasons for the Project's Significance
